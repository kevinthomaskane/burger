# burger

<p>This is a full-stack application that I created from scratch using node.js, express.js, handlebars.js, and mySQL.  The UI/UX is very simple, however the back-end is much more complex.</p>

<p>The "Menu" section references a database created in mySQL and updates automatically.  Each time a new burger is submitted, a new POST request is made, and every time that the burger is eaten, a PUT request is made and updates the burger in mySQL.</p>
